        to its Syntax which is in very crystal clear manner, I have started my journey
        in programming field during this lock-down period by learning Python where I learnt
          all the fundamentals of it by watching online tutorials on Youtube, Documentation
          which are great platform nowadays.</p>

        <p class="lead">Once I completed my Python course then I decided to learn python web framework
        Django which is an amazing thing as it provides inbuilt database sqlite3, its built in
          authentication system to build such an incredible websites and my all three websites
        which are Portfolio website, Live News website, Ice Cream Shop website I built via Django and
        utility called Bootstrap for using (html, css & js), Bootstrap is very useful if you
        wish to build websites in a quickly manner however if you know html, css and js so more power to
        you.</p>
